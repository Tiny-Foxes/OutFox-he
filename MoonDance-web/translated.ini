whatIsOutFox=?Project OutFox מה זה
whatIsOutFoxExplanation=StepMania 5.3, also known as "Project OutFox", is a refactoring of StepMania's internal codebase to improve performance, adhere to modern coding practices, and enhance its capabilities on modern hardware and other platforms (including single-board embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi). Improvements to uncapped frame rate have also been recorded on older hardware, as far back as the Pentium E2180. It also incorporates a new default theme with more integrated features than previous versions, and new internal functions that can be used for future content.
whatIsOutFoxSupport=As it's a continuation of the 5.0.12 and 5.1 codebase (not “5.2”), it remains compatible with almost all existing songs, themes, and noteskins that are supported on these versions (if you do encounter odd behaviour or other issues with older content, please report it to us as a bug).
whatIsOutFoxFiveOne=5.3 is unrelated to 5.1 -3 (sometimes written as 5.1-3), which was a prior build of 5.2 before it was renamed

[alpha-notice]
notices=הערות

whatIsOutFox=?OutFox מה זה
whatIsOutFoxExplanation=<strong>StepMania 5.3 "OutFox"</strong> is the next version of StepMania, under development by Team Rizu — a team of community veterans and other current members of the current StepMania community.
outfoxFocus=We have been focusing on modernizing the engine to improve performance, graphical fidelity, and to refurbish parts of the game that have been neglected.

[front-what-is-stepmania]
whatIsStepmania=?Stepmania מה זה
whatIsStepmaniaExplanation=<strong>StepMania</strong> is an open source rhythm game engine. It is primarily used to simulate the gameplay of <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em>, but it is capable of simulating other types of key-based rhythm games as well. StepMania has been developed since 2000, and has also been used as the engine of commercial arcade dance games such as <em>In the Groove</em>, and <em>Pump it Up Pro</em> and <em>Infinity</em>.

[static-pages-about]
whatIsMoondanceExplanation=Project Moondance is an overall effort to modernize and revitalize the open source rhythm gaming engine "StepMania". It is led by Team Rizu, a development team led by community veteran Squirrel, as well as many other prominent members of the current community.
originsOfMoondance=It was originally conceived as being a complete fork of the engine. However, we have since gained the support of its current lead developer, and are currently working on an experimental branch codenamed Project OutFox – based on version 5.1. OutFox focuses primarily on refactoring low-level portions of the engine in preparation for future development, including code modernization to improve performance, as well as changes to its graphics architecture to provide more complete support for modern hardware.
plansOfMoondance=However, OutFox is only the first stage of our plans: “Serene” is a future project that will significantly refactor the engine to make it a true video game engine for rhythm games, with wide support for various game play styles and input schemes, including touchscreens.

willItWorkWithOldStuff=?'האם זה עדיין יעבוד עם כל השירים/ערכות נושא/וכו
outfoxCompatibility=5.3 builds upon the existing 5.0.12/5.1 beta codebase, and maintaining backwards compatibility with older content is one of our main priorities (in fact, this is one of the reasons why the version number is 5.3 rather than skipping to a higher number like 6.0). Content that worked on 5.0.12/5.1 (including songs, themes, and noteskins) should still work on 5.3. If you experience any issues/weirdness, please report it to us.
noteForDevs=הערה צדדית למפתחים
cmdIsDeprecating=Please note that we are deprecating the use of semicolon-separated <code>cmd()</code> blocks (i.e. <code>"OnCommand=cmd(linear,1.5;diffusealpha,1);" </code>) as a means of placing commands on actors in Lua scripts, as this method is a non-standard Lua function that was created for StepMania, and 5.3 is not optimized with this coding style in mind (themes may experience performance penalties if they use this method). It is strongly recommended that function chaining (i.e. code such as <code>OnCommand=function(self) self:linear(1.5):diffusealpha(1) end, </code>) be used instead.
outfoxWithOtherVersions=?האם אני יכול להתקין את זה לצד גרסאות קיימות
outfoxPortableMode=Yes. Our installer on Windows also defaults to portable mode, so user profile data is stored in your installation directory.
shareContentWithMultipleBuilds=If you would like to have a shared song library between multiple builds, you can use the <code>AdditionalSongFolders</code> preference in <code>Save/Preferences.ini</code> to specify a path.

smoIsDeprecated=.הפעילות של השרת הנוכחי לא עובדת כרגע, אבל יש לנו תוכניות לעתיד לפתח מערכת אונליין מחודשת
whereIsTheSource=?איפה הקוד מקור?/למה אתם לא קוד פתוח
whyItsClosedSource=Right now we are not maintaining a public code repository, but we will open one in the future (with plans for it to succeed 5.1 as the mainline branch in the StepMania repository). As 5.3 is developing at a rapid pace, allowing source code access at this time would allow users to compile their own builds based on incomplete work, which would be difficult for us to debug and support during this phase of development..
howWeWillReleaseTheSource=Our code will be licensed under the Apache License 2.0, an open source license used by a variety of major projects (including Android) that provides stronger protections for our rights to be attributed for our work (particularly within forks), while maintaining the ability for StepMania to remain free and open source as it has always been.
anyQuestionsAboutTheSource=<span style="background-color: transparent;">If you have any questions related to the 5.3 code </span><em style="background-color: transparent;">itself</em><span style="background-color: transparent;">, feel free to ask one of the development team members on our Discord server, and we'll be happy to discuss.</span>
whyOutfoxStarted=The project began as a method to add online and profiles to SM5, but when we looked into the engine to see how this could be appropriated, it was discovered just how much in a sorry state the codebase was, and it looked mostly abandoned. I spoke to Shakesoda in hopes of a resurrection in the form of a team project, and it was requested rather than breaking 10 years of content and community to take the time to make a proper 5.x build that is stable and supports what the community as a whole wants from the game.
backwardCompatiblity=This backward compatibility support has been an absolute git to do, but it's something now we are down the line which we are proud of, as it has brought many players and newcomers to the community, and provided a very stable experience for folks during the lockdown. We will continue to maintain a near 100% compatibility where we can, and this is taken into consideration whenever we plan a new feature or change engine components.
closedSourceProcess=We asked if it was ok to close the source while this process was done, and it was deemed wise for the health of the repo and the need of people who are just wanting to play. Its why we've been around the repo but not on it as taint can happen and we do not wish this. SSC [Spinal Shark Collective, the 5.0.x development team] did this same behaviour before us, so we did not see it as a problem. Some vocal members of the community disagreed, including some of the SM dev team. We have also been compared to past SM repo contributors who may have left a less than savoury memory in the minds of some, and it has also been hard to differentiate from history we have no involvement with.

whatIsFiveTwoWhySkip=?מה זאת גירסא 5.2 ולמה דילגתם עליה
fiveTwoBrokeCompatibility=5.2 was originally intended to be the next version of StepMania. However, it included a number of major changes that broke compatibility with previous versions, and were not well-received by the community and other developers.
fiveTwoCancelled=5.2 was originally meant to be 5.1. However, in response to the reception, it was officially delayed in favour of a new 5.1 that was largely an update to 5.0.12 that did not break compatibility with existing content. This was done under the presumption that the new version (subsequently renamed 5.2) would eventually be completed. However, this did not end up happening.
technical=טכני
controllerDoesntWork=השלט שלי לא עובד, אבל הוא עבד על גרסאות קודמות.
xinputCompliant=Alpha 4.5 switched to using an XInput-compliant input system by default. Additional configuration is needed to use unrecognized controllers in this mode. See <a href="/help/controllers">here</a> for more information on how to map your controller for use in XInput mode on StepMania OutFox.
xinputAndLegacyExplanation=<a href="https://projectmoon.dance/news/stepmania-53-alpha-48-released">As of Alpha 4.8.1</a>, we have introduced a HIDAPI-based "Legacy" input system as an option in the Experimental Settings menu. It is similar in behaviour to the input system seen in SM 5.0, but rewritten. If you are having difficulty getting a controller to work in XInput mode or if it performed better under the input handling of previous versions, we recommend that you try it on Legacy mode.
lagWithRecentProcessor=I have a recent/fast processor and my game is having a lot of problems, why is that?
lagWithRecentProcessorExplanation=Parts of the game are so well-optimised now that they're running <em>too fast</em>, and the rest of the game needs to catch up. We will have a proper fix later, but increasing the amount of background activity (i.e. having other programs running in the background, etc.) is a temporary solution.
simplyLoveCompatibility=לא נותן לי להשתמש על 5.3 Simply Love
simplyLoveCompatibilityExplanation=Simply Love does work on 5.3, but since version 4.8, a compatibility warning has been shown by the theme if an unsupported version of SM is detected. On 4.8, you can press the Escape button twice to bypass the compatibility warning, but 4.9 blocks this workaround.
simplyLoveCompatibilityRemoveCheck=The version check can be removed by opening Scripts/SL-SupportHelpers.lua in the theme, and changing the line
simplyLoveCompatibilityRemovingCheckFrom=<code>if not (t[2] and (t[2]==0 or t[2]==1)) then return false end</code>
to=to
simplyLoveCompatibilityRemovingCheckTo=<code>if not (t[2] and (t[2]==0 or t[2]==1 or t[2]==3)) then return false end</code>
simplyLoveCompatibilityWhy=These issues were brought upon by misunderstandings with the theme's developer over our plans for 5.3 (including concerns over the aforementioned lack of public source repository). These concerns <a href="https://github.com/quietly-turning/Simply-Love-SM5/pull/184#issuecomment-717841953">were able to be resolved</a>, although official support for 5.3 will not be worked on until we transition to public source availability.
simplyLoveTinyFoxesFork=An <a href="https://github.com/Tiny-Foxes/Simply-Love-OutFox">unofficial fork</a> has been created by Project Moondance's TinyFoxes community team, which seeks to perform additional tweaks for compatibility and integrations with 5.3
linux=Linux
libOpenGLError=I get the error "error while loading shared libraries: libOpenGL.so.0:" on Ubuntu 20.04-based distributions
libOpenGLFix=Install the <code>libopengl0</code> package. (<code>sudo apt install libopengl0</code>)
macOS=macOS
issueLaunching=.יש לי בעיות בהפעלת המשחק
noNoteskinsFound=If you receive errors such as "No noteskins found" or other unusual behavior, you will have to change macOS security settings in order for Project OutFox to operate correctly. The OS does not trust unsigned applications, and prevents access to external files unless given manual permission by the user.
quarantineFix=To do this, open Terminal and run the following command: <code>xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/OutFox</code>
alternativePath=Alternatively, you can exclude the path, and drag the folder containing the game executable directly onto the window.
olderMacBuilds=On older builds, macOS Catalina also generated a message stating that the game was requesting permission to receive keystrokes from any application. This was a side effect of previous code that has since been removed.
smallRenderingWindow=.המשחק מופיע קטן בפינה התחתונה של החלון
smallRenderingWindowFix=This is due to the renderer not supporting scaled screens yet. To fix this, right-click the game executable and select "Get info" (or highlight the file and press Command (⌘)+I, and toggle the "Open in Low Resolution" option under General.

[static-pages-help-support]
xinputSwitch=On Alpha 4.5 and newer, we switched to using an XInput-compliant input system.
xinputSwitchAffectedDevices=Due to these changes, not all controllers (such as gamepads, dance pads, and other rhythm game-specific controllers) are guaranteed to function with 5.3 out of the box (even if they were supported on earlier versions), unless a controller mapping profile has been created for that specific controller.
thankJosenTiamat=We would like to thank Josen Tiamat for writing these new instructions for how to configure your controllers for use on 5.3.
stepOne=צעד 1: דברים שצריך לבדוק קודם כל
configKeyMappings=So you started up the game and boom you go to “Config Key/Joy Mappings” and set up your controller, skip this guide because you’re done with what you need to do.
configKeyMappingsImpossible=You can’t configure your Config Key/Joy Mappings! OH NO! (I will get to this)
configKeyMappingsTestInput=Test your input, see if your keys are mapped and if so which ones. By pushing the buttons on the pad it’ll say something to the effect of “Key B 12 – Not Mapped” and if you step/press on the key and nothing shows up it’s not mapped, no big proceed to the next step to set it up.
stepTwo=צעד 2: הדרך קלה
builtGamepadTool=So on to the good stuff. 5.3 has a built in gamepad tool that will automatically take care of most of this for you

mapControllerRecommendations=I would recommend using this screen for most controllers on pc, it takes a lot of the guess work out of the whole thing.

stepThree=Step 3: The not super intuitive way (SDL2 Gamepad Tool)
sdlGamepadTool=There is a nifty tool around called <a href="http://www.generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/">SDL2 Gamepad Tool</a>. You connect your controller (via USB or Bluetooth or however you desire to connect your controller to the PC), and it’ll show up on the top drop down menu.

gameControllerLogImg=<img src="https://projectmoon.dance/storage/app/media/controller-guide/guide_4.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block fr-fic fr-dii">
hastagUseful=The “#” is useful for when you want to have different Mapping Strings for the same gamepad, it basically hides the mapping string from the program reading it. I made 3 different mapping for testing the the program would only recognize one, then I hid the mapping string with a hashtag (pound symbol for you oldies around) and the one not hidden was now seen by the program.
hashtagBasicExplanation=Basically, don’t do multiple mapping strings on the same controller (even if you change the name); the program will work with one at a time and honestly one is all you need. You should be good to go and repeat Step 1 and then go to “Config Key/Joy Mappings” right after and set up your pad.
stillNothing=?עדיין לא עובד
possibleProblems=This hasn’t quite happened to me (I tried with the PS3 DDR mat) but there are 2 types of controllers, a “Hat” type and not. So let’s say for example you hook up a pad/controller and the Dpad you configured up down left and right but “Config Key/Joy Mappings” only allows you to push one of them and the rest don’t work.
possibleSolutions=Try configuring the directions to the analog stick instead and then mapping them again. I don’t think you should have to but it works, I’ve tested this with my PS4 Controller and in fact you can play with analog input.

firstSnapshotExplanation=This was our initial snapshot version. We pushed several new features to this version from our build of 5.0.x we began to work on. We refactored many pointers into streamlined areas and added GL3 to the engine, along with a new mode to enable modern practices. We consider this the beginning of the 5.3 branch, as by this point we had already changed much behind the scenes.
